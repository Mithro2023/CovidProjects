This COVID project in SQL involves analyzing data related to COVID-19 cases and deaths across different countries and continents. The project starts by extracting and filtering relevant data such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population. I then calculate key metrics like the death percentage, which shows the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19 in a specific country. The project also examines total cases against total deaths to understand the severity of the pandemic in various regions. Further analysis includes identifying trends, comparing COVID-19 impact across continents, and visualizing data to gain insights into how different regions have been affected. Overall, the project aims to provide a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 situation worldwide, using SQL to transform and analyze the data effectively.
